Future Slider
=============

Future Slider is designed to be as customisable as possible.
As an experienced developer you'll understand how frustrating it can be to work
with 3rd party modules.  For that reason Future Slider is built around the
widget system, slideshows (banners) are widgets so can be placed anywhere and
individual slides can contain other widgets.
